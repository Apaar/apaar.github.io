Many a time we have to deal with the situation of having to analyse code written by someone else in order to debug errors or improve efficency via methods such as parallelizing or identifying bottlenecks in the code.It is imperitive that we fully understand the code flow, analyse the portions of the code that are most time consuming and work on them.
There are various ways in which we can approch this problem.One is via static code analysis via call graphs and another is Profiling tools like Valgrind/Callgrind and GProf.In this post we will be discussing some of these tools along with some use cases(blastx) and examples.
